            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Message of an Angel to</hi> Cornelius.</p>
                  <p>These are the <hi>Parts:</hi> and, as for the <hi>Apparition, Cornelius saw</hi> that, was <hi>afraid</hi> at that, <hi>questioned</hi> about that: but, as for the <hi>Message,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> revealed that, delivered that, <hi>about the ninth hour of the Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We begin; and, with the <hi>Person,</hi> to whom this <hi>Angel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, to whom this <hi>Message</hi> was sent, we begin. Now, this <hi>Person</hi> was <hi>Cornelius;</hi> who <hi>evidently saw</hi> something, an <hi>Angel</hi> of God: <hi>Suffered</hi> something, was <hi>afraid: said</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>What is it Lord?</hi> His <hi>Questioning,</hi> arising from his <hi>Suffering;</hi> his <hi>Suffering,</hi> at first, from his <hi>seeing</hi> an <hi>Angel of God, in a Vision.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lo:</hi> that is our first <hi>Part:</hi> the <hi>Apparition of an Angel to Cornelius;</hi> wherein, as 'tis clear from the Text (besides the substance of it,) From the Text, four <hi>particular Circumstances</hi> are here considerable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The manner of it, in a <hi>Vision.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>proof</hi> of it, <hi>evidently.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>time</hi> of it, <hi>About the ninth hour of the Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>behaviour</hi> of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> at that time. As touching that <hi>unexpected Apparition,</hi> when he first saw the <hi>Angel, He looked on him, he was afraid, he said</hi> unto him, <hi>What is it Lord?</hi> Let us go on in order. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An <hi>Angel of God came in to Cornelius,</hi> came into his house unto him; which in sense, is no more, then that an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel appeared</hi> unto him, Lo! an <hi>Angel appeared.</hi> So it was then;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170764:5"/>
                     <hi>Angels,</hi> in <hi>assuming Bodies,</hi> frequently, and <hi>visibly appeared</hi> unto Men: And, for that cause (though in their own <hi>Nature,</hi> they were still <hi>Spirits</hi>) they were commonly <hi>called Men,</hi> from that <hi>Form</hi> wherein they appeared<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 18.2.19.5.10. Judg. 13.6, 11. Mat. 28.5, 6. Luk. 24.4. Act. 1.10.</note>. So it was then: But is it so now? No. And here, for the right understanding of what followeth, necessary it is, that we <hi>distinguish</hi> between the <hi>effectual Ministry</hi> of <hi>Angels;</hi> and, the <hi>visible Apparition</hi> of <hi>Angels:</hi> whose <hi>Ministry</hi> we shall never want; though, their <hi>visible Apparition</hi> we do, and shall: that being now <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall,</hi> and not granted to the sonnes of Men, to enjoy the <hi>familiar Presence</hi> of such blessed Creatures: Not granted, and therefore, not to be expected. Neither is it any new thing, to hear, that what hath been in use, and, in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture approved of, at one time, may be justly <hi>antiquated,</hi> at another time; for instance, there is no need now of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> for <hi>Infants,</hi> as once there was<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 17.12.21.4.</note>: No, and therefore, rightly it is <hi>abolished,</hi> neither is there any need now, that a <hi>brasen Serpent</hi> should be <hi>erected on a Pole,</hi> for the <hi>healing benefit</hi> of all beholders, as once it was<note n="g" place="margin">Numb. 21.8.</note>. No. Christ, the <hi>Antitype</hi> is come<note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 3.14.</note>; and the <hi>Type</hi> rightly ceaseth. The <hi>Ʋrim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> the <hi>work of God himself,</hi> delivered unto <hi>Moses,</hi> to be put <hi>in the brest-plate of the high Priest</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 28.30. Lev. 8.8.</note>, even these were lost, while <hi>Israel</hi> was in captivity, in <hi>Babylon:</hi> and, we hear of no use that was made <hi>of them,</hi> or of any benefit received <hi>by them,</hi> ever since; besides, <hi>Miracles</hi> were frequently wrought by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> while he was on <hi>earth;</hi> by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> after his <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension</hi> into <hi>Heaven:</hi> by the <hi>primitive Christians,</hi> for some continuance of time, after the <hi>Apostles dissoultion;</hi> but, in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> time, (it seems less then four hundred years after Christ, they were so ceased, that he <hi>concludes,</hi> that whosoever did then expect a <hi>Miracle,</hi> for the confirmation of his Faith, was himself the <hi>greatest Miracle</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">De civitat Dei. lib. <hi>22.</hi> cap <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note>; thus, the use of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> is ceased, the use of the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> is ceased, the use of the <hi>Ʋrim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> is ceased, the use of <hi>Miracles,</hi> (where the <hi>Seed</hi> of the Gospel is <hi>planted,</hi> and diligently <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi>) is ceased, and, we may truly add to all this, that the frequent <hi>Apparition</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> is now ceased also.</p>
                  <p>It is, but, tis most plain from the Text, that it was not so, when an <hi>Angel of God</hi> appeared to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> it was not so then:

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>manner</hi> of this <hi>Apparition;</hi> in a <hi>Vision:</hi> and <hi>saw in a Vision an Angel of God comeing in to him,</hi> even, into his House, where then he was; Lo!<note n="o" place="margin">2 Cor. 12 7.</note>

                     <note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 1.1.</note>: and, we may say, that, in <hi>divers manners</hi> also, he spake to the <hi>Fathers, before the Prophets,</hi> and to others, afterwards in <hi>divers manners,</hi> as, 1. By <hi>Oracle,</hi> by <hi>Voice,</hi> audibly. So he spake to <hi>Adam,</hi> to the Patriarches, and others, before the Floud, when as yet there was no written word to instruct them. 2. by <hi>Dreams;</hi> when the <hi>mind</hi> only was <hi>awak't,</hi> and not the <hi>man;</hi> like as it is in an <hi>Extasie,</hi> or <hi>Transe,</hi> when all the <hi>Senses,</hi> both <hi>inward,</hi> and <hi>outward,</hi> want their proper use, and operation, that those divine things then revealed, might take the deeper <hi>impression</hi> in the understanding, while the <hi>mind</hi> is wholly withdrawn from that accustomed fellowship, it had before with the body: whereof <hi>Elihu</hi> speaketh in <hi>Job,</hi> thus; <hi>God speaketh in a dream, when deep Sleep falleth upon men, then he openeth the eares of men, and sealeth their instruction</hi>

(To put that last, which is the word of the <hi>Text,</hi> expressing the <hi>Manner</hi> of this <hi>apparition,</hi>) God spake unto men by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:</hi> which were of two sorts, either, <hi>Visions of the night,</hi> when men were asleep: or <hi>Visions of the day,</hi> (such as this was we now speak of,) when men were awake, and had the
